    "Johnson & Sons company manufactures 6 types of toys. Each toy is produced by utilizing at least one Machine 1-4, requiring a different production time (see Table below). For instance, product A requires 4 minutes on Machine 1, 4 minutes on Machine 2, 0 Minutes on Machine 3, and 0 minutes on Machine 4 (all machines must be utilized to produce a toy unless the production time equals 0). Each machine is available for a different number of hours per week. The company aims to identify the number (product-mix) of toys that must be manufactured to maximize the income (can be continuous). Notably, each toy can be sold for a different price. Due to market expectations, the company wants to manufacture twice as many F toys as A. Furthermore, the number of toys B should equal C. Solve this problem using the PuLP library. Prepare a report (in the jupyter notebook) containing information on the following:\n",
